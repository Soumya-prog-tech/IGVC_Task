It is not fully correct. If we consider four quandrants of the lane, the robot is able to move only in one of the quadrants. I tried to fix this problem by considering a center of the map, and ensuring that it goes to atleast one box of each quadrant but it goes into inifnite interation when i do that. I am thinking on it...
